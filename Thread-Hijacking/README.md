Starting a suspended process involves creating a new process in a suspended state. 
The process is created but not immediately executed, allowing the attacker to manipulate it before it runs any code.

We Can Also Run the Payload With Out Starting Any New Threads as all Threads Start in a suspened state which means we can hijack them

    Create Suspended Process: The attacker or system creates a new process in a suspended state using functions like CreateProcess with the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag in Windows.
    Inject Code: The attacker injects malicious code into the newly created process's address space. This can be done using techniques like writing directly to the process memory with WriteProcessMemory.
    Modify Execution Context: The attacker modifies the execution context (e.g., instruction pointer) of the suspended process to ensure that, when resumed, it executes the injected code.
    Resume Process: The attacker resumes the process, allowing it to execute the injected code.
