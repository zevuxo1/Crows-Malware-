This Project is a step up From direct syscalls, We Are using Indirect Syscalls

The Reason We Should Use Indirect Over direct is because a normal program should never have to issue syscall, 9/10 that takes place inside NTDLL.dll
So it adds alot of suspicion To Our Malware

indirect syscalls still can bypass API hooking except this time we create the syscall stub then jump to the actual SYSCALL address inside Ntdll.dll
so it looks like Ntdll Is still issuing the SYSCALL but we still bypass API hooking
