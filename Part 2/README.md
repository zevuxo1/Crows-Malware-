It Is Kind Of the Sane As Process Injection it just differs on what we are injecting
Instead Of Straight up injecting Shellcode into it we first load a DLL into the targets memory which then injects shellcode into it

Once Again i Added Some Extra Stuff (Same Stuff as Part 1)

  Xor Encrypted Shellcode
  Loop Through Processes Till We Find Notepad.exe then load the DLL into its memory

TO COMPILE

    MAKE SURE IT IS COMPILED TO X64

    DLL.c
      gcc -shared -o implant.dll dll.c

    INJECT.c
      gcc -o inject inject.c
