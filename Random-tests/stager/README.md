Just Shows the basic's of creating a stager, it downloads shellcode from a server then injects it into notepad, seems to help alot since the shellcode isnt directly stored inside the file

I Know There is Better ways to download the payload other then spawning a cmd.exe then running curl -s
Ill Practice with WINHTTP, sockets ect
