For This First Part We Are Making the Classic Shell Code Injection By Utilzing Functions such as 

    OpenProcess()
    VirtualAllocEX()
    WriteProcessMemory()
    CreateRemoteThreadEx()
    WaitForSingleObject()

I Added Some Of my own function after doing some research on basic AV bypass
I Added XOR encrpyted Shellcode which gets decrypted at run time And Took Crows Advice
and did some research into VirtualProtectEx() To Change the permissions From RW to RX After Writing the shellcode

After Adding these features i succesfully able to inject the shellcode while having a fully patched Windows System With WD running

WITH PLAIN MSFVENOM SHELLCODE
