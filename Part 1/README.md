For This First Part We Are Making the Classic Shell Code Injection By Utilzing Functions such as 

    OpenProcess()
    VirtualAllocEX()
    WriteProcessMemory()
    CreateRemoteThreadEx()
    WaitForSingleObject()

I Added Some Of my own function after doing some research on basic AV bypass

    Added XOR encrypted Shellcode that gets decrypted at run-time
    Added a Function To Loop Through All Running Processes Till It Finds Notepad.exe
    Added Some Checks That see If ram <= 2gb, less then 2 processors and if the Storage is less then 100gb 
    To Try Evade Dynamic analysis

    I Got These Samples From
    https://0xpat.github.io/Malware_development_part_2/

and did some research into VirtualProtectEx() To Change the permissions From RW to RX After Writing the shellcode
