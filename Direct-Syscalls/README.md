For Part 4 Of Crows Malware series, we moved even lower and learnt How to create direct syscalls, this has multplite benfiets like

    Antivirus and EDR Bypass: Direct syscalls can help evade detection by antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems. 
    These security tools often hook and monitor NTAPI functions to detect malicious activity. By using direct syscalls.
    malware can bypass these hooks, making it harder for security software to detect and stop the malicious code.

    Reduced Overhead: NTAPI functions add a layer of abstraction over the actual syscalls, which can introduce additional overhead due to the extra function calls and checks. 
    leading to marginally better performance, which can be critical in performance-sensitive applications such as high-frequency trading systems or low-latency applications.
    Directly invoking syscalls can reduce this overhead 

NOTE FOR SETUP

    FOR .ASM FILES
      Build-Dependieces -> Build Customization -> Check MASM

      Create .asm File
        Right Click -> Properties -> Exclude From Build = no
